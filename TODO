TODO:

* Add commands to:
  * Reply to a private message
  * Reply to a channel message
* Implement relevant parts of CTCP
* Discard events generated by the bot (parts, joins, others) (?)
* Handle PINGs
* Detect when using a registered nick. 
* Add ability to reply both to public (by prefixing the username) and private messages 
* Bot should reconnect upon disconnection
* IRC protocol error handling (probably each command should return its own errors).
* Trap signals.
* Use non blocking IO for logging when available.
* Find out what's the problem with heinlein.freenode.net
* Rethink all the configuration model. It's getting messy.
